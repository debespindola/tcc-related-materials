# Impacto dos LLMs nas práticas pedagógicas: Um olhar crítico a partir do Ensino Médio privado

## ABSTRACT
This study examines the implementation and impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on pedagogical practices in private high schools. Using interviews with teachers and an wide literature review, we investigate educators’ familiarity and attitudes towards these emerging technologies. The results indicate that LLMs have the potential to enrich the school curriculum, enhance pedagogical interaction, and support educational decision-making. However, lack of training, ethical concerns, and technological limitations are significant challenges. The research emphasizes the need for a strategic approach to the effective implementation of these technologies, addressing privacy, equity, and inclusion issues. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the opportunities and limitations of LLMs in education, offering recommendations for their future adoption.
